#4 - Top Companies - Due: Feb 3

Just as with last week, I've put together a data file for you. In this case, companies.js defines a variable named companies, containing data pulled from the Seattle Times' "Top Northwest Companies" rankings. Each object in the array contains the following properties:

    rank - Rank for this year
    previous - Rank for last year (if listed, otherwise "")
    company - Name of the company
    hq - Location of headquarters
    sector - Business sector ("computer", "travel", "business")
    symbol - Stock symbol
    roic - Return on invested capital
    marketCap - Current market capitalization
    freeCash - Free cash
    sales - Total sales
    profit - Total profit
    profitDelta - Change in profit from last year's value
    roa - Return on assets (I think?)
    employees - Employee count
    pe - Price/Earnings ratio 

Don't worry if you don't understand the financial jargon â€” I don't understand all of it myself, and we won't be using the more esoteric columns. Answer the following questions using the information in this array:

    What's the smallest company (in terms of employee count) on the list?
    Several companies lost money this year: they had a negative profit. What were these companies?
    What's the average market cap for companies in the manufacturing sector?
    (optional, not for credit) Which sector has the highest number of employees? Which has the lowest?
    (optional, not for credit) Which company had the highest gain in ranking from the previous year, and which had the highest drop in ranking?
